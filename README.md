# Moduel 2 Stock Analysis with VBA

## Overview of Project

Steve is helping his parents research the best green energy stocks. He has a dataset of stocks that he wants analyzed, but would like to use the same analysis on new data in the future.  To do this we wrote a macro using VBA to automate the calculations. The original macro needed to be refactored for performance to allow for more data to be analyzed while minimizing the runtime.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to refactor the original macro to use less memory and run the analysis more quickly.

## Results
